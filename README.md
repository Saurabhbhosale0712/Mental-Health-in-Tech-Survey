# Mental-Health-in-Tech-Survey


Based on the model performance comparison, let's analyze and justify the best model for the given Mental Health dataset:


### 1. **Random Forest**:
   - **Accuracy**: 76.19%
   - **Precision**: 75.20%
   - **Recall**: 76.42%
   - **F1-score**: 75.81%
   - **ROC-AUC**: 76.20%

   **Justification**: Random Forest is performing the best overall. The higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score indicate that the dataset benefits from tree-based ensemble techniques. Random Forest is known for handling complex relationships and interactions between features well, and this model's performance suggests that the mental health dataset has non-linear and complex relationships, which tree-based methods can handle effectively. The model captures a balance between true positive rate and false positive rate, making it the most reliable for this dataset.

### 2. **XGBoost**:
   - **Accuracy**: 72.62%
   - **Precision**: 73.28%
   - **Recall**: 69.11%
   - **F1-score**: 71.13%
   - **ROC-AUC**: 72.54%

   **Justification**: XGBoost is still performing relatively well, but not as well as Random Forest. While boosting techniques are known for improving predictive accuracy through iterative learning, it seems that the dataset may not be benefiting as much from boosting here, as seen by the lower recall score. This could indicate that some nuances in the data are not being captured as well by XGBoost.

### 3. **Logistic Regression**:
   - **Accuracy**: 71.83%
   - **Precision**: 70.97%
   - **Recall**: 71.54%
   - **F1-score**: 71.26%
   - **ROC-AUC**: 71.82%

   **Justification**: Logistic Regression is performing reasonably well, which suggests that the dataset may have some level of linearity. However, the lower performance compared to Random Forest and XGBoost suggests that the mental health dataset has some complexity that linear models like Logistic Regression cannot fully capture.

### 4. **Neural Network**:
   - **Accuracy**: 60.32%
   - **Precision**: 59.20%
   - **Recall**: 60.16%
   - **F1-score**: 59.68%
   - **ROC-AUC**: 60.31%

   **Justification**: Neural Networks, though capable of learning complex patterns, are underperforming in this case. This could suggest that the dataset may not have enough intricate, non-linear patterns that would benefit from a neural network. The neural network's performance is significantly lower in all metrics, indicating that simpler models (like Random Forest) are more appropriate for this dataset.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, **Random Forest** is the best-performing model. This indicates that the dataset likely has complex, non-linear relationships that are better captured by tree-based methods like Random Forest.
